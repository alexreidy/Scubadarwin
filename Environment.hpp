// Zones are direct descendents of SimEntity, which
// doesn't support constituents, which are essential to our
// "touch->affect" architecture. We don't want to
// have a special loop for Zones, though, so we instead
// make them constituents of a CompoundSimEntity container
// such that they affect other SimEntity constituents.
